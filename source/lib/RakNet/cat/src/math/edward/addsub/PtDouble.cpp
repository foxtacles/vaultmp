	The group laws used for point addition/doubling are the best in the
	literature at this time, requiring no branches just a straight shot
	through field operations.

	I have tweaked the order of operations to improve cache locality.

	On 32-bit platforms CPU time is broken down as:

	[PtDouble] time spent in misc operations: 1350
	[PtDouble] time spent in multiplies: 2707
	[PtDouble] time spent in squares: 2078
	[PtDouble] MrAdd 1: 390
	[PtDouble] MrDouble: 157
	[PtDouble] MrNegate: 120
	[PtDouble] MrAdd 2: 120
	[PtDouble] MrSubtract 1: 285
	[PtDouble] MrSubtract 2: 165
	[PtDouble] MrAdd 3: 113

	[PtEDouble] time spent in misc operations: 1320
	[PtEDouble] time spent in multiplies: 3083
	[PtEDouble] time spent in squares: 2032
	[PtEDouble] MrAdd 1: 405
	[PtEDouble] MrDouble: 150
	[PtEDouble] MrNegate: 120
