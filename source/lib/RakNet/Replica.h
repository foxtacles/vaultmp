/// This is an interface of a replicated object for use in the framework of ReplicaManager
/// You should derive from this class, implementing the functions to provide the behavior you want.
/// If your architecture doesn't allow you to derive from this class, you can store an instance of a derived instance of this class in your base game object.
/// In that case, use GetParent() and SetParent() and propagate the function calls up to your real classes. For an example where I do this, see Monster.h in the ReplicaManagerCS sample.
/// \note All send functions are called one for every target recipient, so you can customize the data sent per-user.

	/// This function is called in the first update tick after this object is first passed to ReplicaManager::Replicate for each player, and also when a new participant joins
	/// The intent of this function is to tell another system to create an instance of this class.
	/// You can do this however you want - I recommend having each class having a string identifier which is registered with StringTable, and then using EncodeString to write the name of the class.  In the callback passed to SetReceiveConstructionCB create an instance of the object based on that string.
	/// \note If you return true from IsNetworkIDAuthority, which you should do for a server or peer, I recommend encoding the value returned by GetNetworkID() into your bitstream and calling SetNetworkID with that value in your SetReceiveConstructionCB callback.
	/// \note Dereplicate, SetScope, and SignalSerializeNeeded all rely on being able to call GET_OBJECT_FROM_ID which requires that SetNetworkID be called on that object.
	/// \note SendConstruction is called once for every new player that connects and every existing player when an object is passed to Replicate.
	/// \param[in] currentTime The current time that would be returned by RakNet::GetTimeMS().  That's a slow call I do already, so you can use the parameter instead of having to call it yourself.
	/// \param[in] systemAddress The participant to send to.
	/// \param[in,out] flags Per-object per-system serialization flags modified by this function, ReplicaManager::SignalSerializationFlags, and ReplicaManager::AccessSerializationFlags.  Useful for simple customization of what you serialize based on application events.  This value is not automatically reset.
	/// \param[out] outBitStream The data you want to write in the message. If you do not write to outBitStream and return true, then no send call will occur and the system will consider this object as not created on that remote system.
