There is currently no installer, sorry.  If somebody wants to take a
crack at it, please go ahead.

This project is not intended to be installed on your system, but to be
used as part of an application or project.  It is written to the POSIX
time.h standard and should work with any ANSI C 89 compiler.

This project consists of a few C and header files which should be copied
and built like any other ANSI C code.

1) Copy time64.c, time64.h and time64_config.h into your C project.
2) Tweak configuration values in time64_config.h.
3) #include "time64.h" in your code and make use of the new functions
   in place of time.h's.
4) Build your C project normally.
